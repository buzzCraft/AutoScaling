# Project Ruby Acorn

## Overview
Project Ruby Acorn is developed as part of the Agile course at OsloMet, during the autumn of 2023. This project leverages Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices to build the required infrastructure and to implement operational dashboards using Prometheus.

## Scaling Strategy
The project employs a dual scaling strategy to ensure optimal resource management and to facilitate various simulation scenarios:
1. **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Automated starting and stopping of virtual machines (VMs) based on current load, ensuring efficient use of resources.
2. **Simulation for Scalability Testing:** Utilizing simulated VMs to test different load scenarios, which helps in understanding the system's behavior under varied conditions.
